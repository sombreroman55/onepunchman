# Wife Thermometer
My wife says the bedroom is cold on her side every night. Let's make a simple temperature sensor to
see how cold it is.

# Parts
- 4-digit 7-segment display
- Temperature sensor

# Outline
- Sample the temp sensor all the time
- Covert from C to F
- Show the current temperature
Pretty simple
