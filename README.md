# onepunchman
My dump repository for all things practice and "training".

The name was inspired by Saitama's training routine, although my habits and these projects share no
resemblance to that. Just a fun name to remind me to get in here every day and train a little bit.

There will be projects of varying size, simple on-off things, design documents for things I probably
won't actually implement, and whatever else helps me hone my craft.
